Step 1:  Head over to Python 3.5.x from python.org

 

Step 2:  Go to the Downloads page and Select the 3.5.2 download.

Step 3:  After that you will be brought to another page, where you will need to select either the x86-64 or amd64 installer.

The one I specifically recommend for now is the Windows x86-64 executable installer.

 

Step 4:  For the purpose of this article I’ll be choosing to Add Python 3.5 to PATH.

 

Step 5:  Now you should be able to see a message saying Setup was successful. A way to confirm that it has installed successfully is to open your Command Prompt and check the version.




Open up the Start menu, search for cmd and then right click on it and Run as an administrator.

Just enter this command:
C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
